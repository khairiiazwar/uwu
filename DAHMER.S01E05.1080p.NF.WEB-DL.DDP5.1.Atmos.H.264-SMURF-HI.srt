00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,429
- [water running]
- [tap creaks]

2
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:14,723
[grandmother] <i>So they got you
on the night shift, huh?</i>

3
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:16,932
Yep.

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,106
Well, don't bring home any chocolate.
I'm watching my figure.

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:24,607
[Jeffrey] Right.

6
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,947
What do they have you doing there anyway?

7
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,115
[Jeffrey] Nothing.

8
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:35,326
[grandmother] I don't think
they're paying you for doing nothing.

9
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,912
Why don't you want to talk about it?

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:41,958
There's nothing to talk about.
I just mix the chocolate all night long.

11
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,711
All right, fine. I was just asking.

12
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:47,672
[sighs]

13
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:27,337
[Kennedy] <i>So you thought he was beautiful.</i>

14
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:32,258
<i>And you went to his funeral
even though you had never met him.</i>

15
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,384
[Jeffrey] <i>Yes.</i>

16
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:39,182
[Jeffrey] <i>I, uh, went to
the wake and everything,</i>

17
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:45,313
<i>and, uh, that's when I decided
I was gonna dig him up.</i>

18
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,149
[Murphy] <i>And what did you plan on doing?</i>

19
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,447
[Jeffrey] <i>I just wanted to lay with him.</i>

20
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,201
<i>While he was still fresh and just, uh...</i>

21
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:04,666
<i>hold him.</i>

22
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,751
[melancholy music playing]

23
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,341
[Jeffrey] <i>But, uh... it didn't work.</i>

24
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,052
[shovel banging]

25
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:21,975
[panting]

26
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:27,605
It was March and the ground was too hard,
and it would have taken forever. So...

27
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,277
But I wish I could have dug him up.

28
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,989
I think if I had, then, uh...

29
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,160
I wouldn't have done all the stuff after.

30
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,872
Might've just been the end of it.

31
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,212
Jeff, can you...

32
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,493
Just help us understand a little.

33
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,595
What do you think drove you
to try to dig up a dead body?

34
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,723
You know,
because most people wouldn't do that.

35
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,561
Um...

36
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:14,319
I guess, uh...

37
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,200
I guess I just...

38
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,953
I hoped that he could be, uh,

39
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:29,876
somebody that wanted
to see a movie that I wanted to see.

40
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,838
[Kennedy] You wanted
to control these guys?

41
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:37,507
Yeah.

42
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,387
Yeah, 'cause, uh...

43
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,769
well, everybody was always
tellin' me what to do.

44
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:52,607
You know, my dad, my grandma, my bosses.

45
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,984
The guys were just, uh...

46
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,447
the one thing in my life
that I could control.

47
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,500
So Jeff... [clears throat]

48
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:14,212
...just going back,
talking about Steven Hicks...

49
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,049
you say that was accidental.

50
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:20,969
Uh...

51
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:23,137
Which one was he? Was that the hitchhiker?

52
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,221
Yes.

53
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,976
Okay, 'cause I never
knew their names most of the time.

54
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:31,104
You <i>should </i>know their names.
These are people you killed.

55
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:40,738
So, Steven Hicks, the hitchhiker.

56
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,451
That was an accident.

57
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:51,374
[Kennedy] And Steven Tuomi,
he was the one at the, uh, hotel downtown.

58
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,462
Hmm.

59
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:58,840
Both Steves.

60
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,428
[chair creaks]

61
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,263
That was an accident as well?

62
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,267
Yeah.

63
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,729
I mean, I didn't mean to kill him.

64
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:18,026
I didn't want to kill him, but...
I must've.

65
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,363
So yeah, accidental.

66
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,075
Drugged myself too on accident.

67
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,496
So, what changed then?

68
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:35,001
Because after that,
you started killing people on purpose.

69
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,505
Well...

70
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,927
I started in with the drinking more.

71
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,638
A lot of solitary drinking.

72
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,141
And I just...

73
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,520
started to feel more and more...

74
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:57,564
alone.

75
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,694
<i>When I was, uh, living with my grandma,</i>

76
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:04,113
<i>I'd, uh, go to the bars</i>

77
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:07,700
<i>and I'd pick someone up</i>

78
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,286
and take 'em back to her house.

79
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,808
And I'd drug 'em.

80
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,853
<i>And then I'd take 'em downstairs
to the fruit cellar.</i>

81
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:39,857
<i>Then I'd strangle them
once they were unconscious</i>

82
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,361
'cause I didn't want them to suffer.

83
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,990
[panting]

84
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,493
[bones crack]

85
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,747
[continues panting]

86
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,196
[eerie music playing]

87
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,584
And how many did you kill
at your grandma's house, if you remember?

88
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,253
Uh...

89
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:32,970
Um...

90
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:39,810
Three?

91
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,233
[Murphy] <i>Can you describe them?</i>

92
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,738
[Jeffrey] <i>Well, one guy was Black,</i>

93
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,866
<i>one was a Chicano,</i>

94
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,704
<i>and, uh, another was Indian
or American Indian.</i>

95
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:04,085
It was just about
if, if I thought that they were beautiful.

96
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,337
I'm not buying that.

97
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,589
You targeted your victims.

98
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,634
Sorry?

99
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:15,721
You purposefully moved
into an apartment in the Black community.

100
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,308
It's what I could afford, sir.

101
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,937
To an area that was
under-patrolled and underserved,

102
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,022
and you knew that, isn't that right?

103
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:28,109
Easier to get away with things there,

104
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,610
easier to hunt.

105
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,911
So you get 'em down there, then what?

106
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:41,497
Um...

107
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:46,961
Well, at that point, I'd just kinda panic,

108
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:51,882
you know, like, my grandma
was gonna come down there and find 'em.

109
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:56,178
But she didn't like
going down those stairs.

110
00:09:56,679 --> 00:10:00,641
So, I knew I was pretty much safe.

111
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,437
But, uh, well,

112
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,480
then she started to notice the smell.

113
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,402
[sniffs]

114
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,085
[sawing sounds]

115
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:29,669
Jeff?

116
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:32,048
[Jeffrey] <i>But I figured out how to do it.</i>

117
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:38,262
<i>You just, uh,
triple-bag the body parts and...</i>

118
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,346
Hey, Grandma.

119
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,098
<i>...throw 'em in the trash and...</i>

120
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,182
Ya winning?

121
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,897
<i>...doesn't smell at all, really.</i>

122
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,321
And Jeff, did you...

123
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,576
You were, what?
Doin' experiments on the bodies?

124
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,036
Yeah.

125
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,705
[sawing]

126
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,877
[Jeffrey] <i>I'd soak some parts
in acid or, uh,</i>

127
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:14,382
<i>sometimes just boil 'em
till the flesh came off.</i>

128
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,465
Ah!

129
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:18,552
The, uh...

130
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:24,975
You know,
the compulsion had just taken over

131
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,727
completely at that point.

132
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,730
I wasn't even trying to stop it.

133
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,240
Can I just get the electric chair,
you think?

134
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,539
Jeff, did you ever hear voices?

135
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:48,498
No.

136
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:50,835
I'm not insane.

137
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,005
It just got really easy, is the problem.

138
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,758
That's why it kept happening.

139
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,970
[Murphy] And your grandma
never suspected anything?

140
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,850
No, she suspected something, just...

141
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,979
not what I was actually doing,
I don't think.

142
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,857
<i>Said she heard a thud one time.</i>

143
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,984
- [loud rattling]
- [gasps] Jeff?

144
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,236
[Jeffrey] Go back to bed.

145
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:20,614
<i>I just told her I fell.</i>

146
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:29,165
<i>She saw I brought guys home, I think.</i>

147
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,418
<i>But, uh...</i>

148
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:37,631
<i>she didn't want to accept what that meant.</i>

149
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,135
[Kennedy] <i>That you were...</i>

150
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:48,350
Yeah, I think she just

151
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:51,937
didn't want to know about my, uh...

152
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,734
lifestyle and whatnot.

153
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:00,362
But she noticed the smell?

154
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,324
Yeah.

155
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,120
July and August I kinda dreaded
'cause it got so humid down there.

156
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,748
No AC.

157
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:15,127
Jeff! Something smells real bad
down in the cellar.

158
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:16,837
[door slams]

159
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:20,925
[sighs] It's my taxidermy stuff.
I told you that already.

160
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:23,385
[sighs]

161
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:28,182
[woman on TV]
<i>And for tonight's crime report,</i>

162
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,892
<i>police are asking for the public's help</i>

163
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:32,311
<i>in finding the people
responsible for a fire</i>

164
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,979
<i>that destroyed a home in Stafford.</i>

165
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,439
[footsteps approaching]

166
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,735
Jeff, the smell.

167
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,111
[Jeffrey] Oh...

168
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,156
Uh, yeah. I seen it.

169
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,159
It's a dead raccoon under the back porch.

170
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,911
Can't get to it.

171
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,247
Don't worry though.

172
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,208
It'll smell for a while,
and then it'll stop.

173
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,260
Why don't you think she did anything?

174
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,013
I mean, that smell, flesh decomposing,

175
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,349
that's a very distinctive smell.

176
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:14,770
I mean, we are kinda hardwired
to be repulsed by that.

177
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,024
Well, not everybody.

178
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,946
But, uh, yeah, I'm not sure.

179
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,030
I think she, uh...

180
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:30,411
I think maybe
she was deliberately not seeing it.

181
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,163
[vacuum whirring]

182
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:40,087
[Jeffrey] <i>But when she found my altar,
she kinda blew her top.</i>

183
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,300
[grandmother]
Watch yourself on those stairs!

184
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,846
Oh God! You can't smell that, Jeff?

185
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,389
No.

186
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:51,765
Oh!

187
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,685
No wonder your nana's upset.

188
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,646
I am too now.

189
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,233
Well, that's what it smells like, Dad.

190
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:04,653
Animals and stuff.
Taxidermy, it's my hobby.

191
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,197
Unlock it, Jeff.

192
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:12,411
- I left the key at work, I think.
- Jeff, unlock it.

193
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,462
Let me see.

194
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,469
Oh, yeah.

195
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,931
It is here.

196
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,147
You're the one
that taught me to do it, you know.

197
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,650
[discordant piano notes playing]

198
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,735
And now, you're, like...

199
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,738
[sighs]

200
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,289
[exhales]

201
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:04,713
Wait a minute.

202
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,426
You use <i>that </i>saw to cut up roadkill?

203
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,764
It's big enough. Yeah.

204
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,225
Like, a woodchuck skull?

205
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,894
Can't do it with a smaller one.

206
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:29,238
What is that?

207
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,448
[Jeffrey] What?

208
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,077
[Lionel] What the heck?

209
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,289
What?

210
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:43,335
[coughs]

211
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,465
[coughs]

212
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:51,093
What the heck? What is this?

213
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:54,513
It's just... It's one of my experiments.

214
00:16:55,180 --> 00:17:00,227
I was just using chemicals
to try to melt the flesh and the fur off.

215
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,354
Think that one was a skunk.

216
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,356
Oh, you think so, Jeff?

217
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,568
You think you could have washed
the skunk sludge down the drain better?

218
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:09,945
Jeez, Jeff!

219
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,364
- Sorry, Dad.
- God!

220
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,950
I'll quit doing it.

221
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,618
I mean it though.

222
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,665
Yeah, I said I'd stop. I'll stop.

223
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:27,212
Yeah, and, uh, get rid of that comic book
devil stuff too, goddammit.

224
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,590
I know you say
it comes from a movie and all,

225
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,092
but it's just too much for your grandma.

226
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,094
You know that.

227
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,016
Okay. I will.

228
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,477
I promise.

229
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:45,189
So, you did stop?

230
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,315
Oh, yeah.

231
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,611
For a while, months.

232
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:55,574
It's funny.

233
00:17:56,325 --> 00:18:00,621
Once I stopped,
that's when I started to get scared.

234
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,375
I just kept waiting to get caught.

235
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:09,713
You know, every cop car I heard,
I thought they were coming for me.

236
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:14,218
But, uh... never did.

237
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,513
And I'd watch the news,

238
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,182
but there was never any story
about anybody goin' missing

239
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,141
or anything like that.

240
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,143
And why do you think that was?

241
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:32,694
So then I thought that, uh,

242
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,656
I wasn't gonna get caught,

243
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,367
if I was careful.

244
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:44,456
Which made not doing it really hard.

245
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,548
But I did try to not do it.

246
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,299
For, uh...

247
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:59,012
long periods of time.

248
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:07,437
This one time...

249
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,858
I really did screw up.

250
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,714
[engine sputtering]

251
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,384
No, man.

252
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,179
[engine sputtering]

253
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,763
Come on. Come on.

254
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,849
[engine sputtering]

255
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,601
Fuck!

256
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,854
Come on, baby.

257
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:51,023
[engine sputtering]

258
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,024
[knocking]

259
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,568
- What the fuck? Jesus!
- Don't worry, I'm not a cop!

260
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:56,403
What?

261
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:59,114
I seen you at the bar. [chuckles]

262
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,825
You need some help?

263
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,077
Uh, no. I'm all right.

264
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,705
Just a... dead battery.

265
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
Ugh.

266
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,210
I don't know how you're gonna fix that.
You should let me help you.

267
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:13,003
- [sighs]
- I was just...

268
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,005
My grandma's house
is just around the corner.

269
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:19,509
We can get my car,
drive back here, and give you a jump.

270
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,970
Okay. Thanks.

271
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,054
Yeah.

272
00:20:24,681 --> 00:20:27,809
Uh, I'll just wait here then.

273
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,730
No, you should come with.

274
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,484
This is a rough area.
You shouldn't just be sitting there.

275
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,738
Come on. Let's grab a taxi
before we get robbed.

276
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,289
Thanks a lot.

277
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,373
You bet.

278
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:51,415
What's your name?

279
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,458
Jeff.

280
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,003
Thanks, Jeff. I'm Ron.

281
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,130
- You lock it, Ron?
- Yeah.

282
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,466
- Good.
- So you live around here?

283
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:03,345
Yeah, my grandma's.
Just for... just for now.

284
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,180
[door unlocking]

285
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:08,600
[whispering] Come on in.

286
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,063
Hey, we gotta be quiet though.

287
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,733
Otherwise, the beast will wake up
and start chewing me out.

288
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:23,907
Come on in.

289
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,413
Here, just make yourself at home.

290
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,292
I gotta find my car keys.

291
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,337
[fridge door opens]

292
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,172
[can pops open]

293
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,341
[Jeffrey] Oh God.

294
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:50,517
Hey, you wanna see the fruit cellar?

295
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:52,686
Fruit cellar?

296
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:57,190
Nah, man. Look, I'm just here because
you said you could give me a hand, okay?

297
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,069
Yeah, I'm gonna help you. I just...

298
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,072
I gotta find my car keys.

299
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,869
Just... Why don't you sit down?
Do you want a drink?

300
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:12,748
No, I do not. I gotta work in the morning!
If that's not what you had in mind...

301
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,125
Fine, quiet! I'm just being polite.

302
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,961
Seeing if you want something is all,

303
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,255
while you wait.

304
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,054
You want a coffee or something?

305
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,637
Fine.

306
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,141
But make it quick.

307
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,687
Yes, sir. Sanka okay?

308
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,397
Sanka's fine. Thank you.

309
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:39,024
Don't get quicker than that.

310
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:54,539
[water running]

311
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,125
[faint clanging]

312
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,754
[indistinct talking]

313
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:01,838
[groans]

314
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,680
[microwave whirring, dings]

315
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,400
[yawns]

316
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,861
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

317
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,115
[exhales]

318
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,836
Is somebody down there with you, Jeff?

319
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:46,049
I'm fine, Grandma! It's just my friend!

320
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,552
[grandmother] It's very late, Jeff!

321
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,845
Yeah, we know!

322
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,596
Jeez.

323
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,391
You know there's nothing
happening here tonight, right?

324
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,144
Like, I've made that pretty clear.

325
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,188
We're not sleeping together or nothing.

326
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,398
[scoffs]

327
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,901
Well,

328
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,279
we'll see.

329
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:11,950
All right. Fuck you. I'm outta here.

330
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,330
[groans]

331
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,250
[Jeffrey faintly] Good luck with that.

332
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,007
You okay?

333
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,759
[Ron] Yeah, I just

334
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,137
got real light-headed.

335
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:34,139
[grandmother] Jeff?

336
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,765
[Ron] I think I'm gonna throw up.

337
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:38,143
[Jeffrey] Just sit down a sec.

338
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,770
- There you go. Just relax.
- [grunts]

339
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:41,938
It's okay.

340
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,148
[faintly] It's okay.

341
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,276
[Ron] You put
something in that, didn't you?

342
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,862
[grandmother] Jeff!

343
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,613
[yells] What?

344
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:53,575
[grandmother] I think your friend
should go home now, Jeff!

345
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,495
Yeah, we're leaving now, okay?

346
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,412
Good night.

347
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,334
You're so beautiful.

348
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:08,464
Jeff!

349
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:10,717
Who is that?

350
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,636
[Jeffrey] It's just my friend.

351
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,764
I didn't know you had Black friends, Jeff.

352
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,768
Well, it's not the 1920s anymore
or whatever, Grandma.

353
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,478
Yes. I know that.

354
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:23,688
What's wrong with him?

355
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:26,066
Nothing.
He just had a little too much to drink.

356
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,068
I'm just trying to sober him up.

357
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,361
You've been drinking.

358
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,487
No, I haven't.

359
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,031
Is he gonna be sick?

360
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:35,450
Just go back to bed, Grandma.

361
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,745
You should take
that young man to a hospital.

362
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,665
What? He's just a little wasted, Grandma.

363
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:46,336
I will not have some stranger
dying in my house!

364
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,089
He'll be fine!
Just let him sleep it off! Jeez!

365
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,172
No!

366
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,803
Something is not right here.
I'm calling your father.

367
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:57,472
Hey! Nobody's calling anybody, okay?

368
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:01,601
He had a little too much to drink.
He's just gonna sleep it off.

369
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,522
Now, go back to bed.

370
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,655
What are you doing?

371
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,825
I am giving this young man a blanket.

372
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:21,955
And I am staying down here
and watching him until he wakes up.

373
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,790
You don't have to do that!

374
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:28,211
And if this young man is sick,
I am taking him to a hospital.

375
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,963
Do you understand?

376
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:34,134
Well, drinking is what you were doing,
and God knows what else.

377
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,261
- [bangs]
- This is fucking unreal!

378
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,139
You watch your mouth, young man!

379
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,892
You want to go up to your room,
fine, but I am staying right here!

380
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,896
And you can bet your sweet bippy
your father's gonna hear about this.

381
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:00,952
If you're so worried about him, Grandma,
why don't you call an ambulance then?

382
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,834
Oh, I know why.

383
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,309
[birds chirping]

384
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:39,532
Hi, buddy.

385
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:43,161
Let's get you home.

[grandmother]
<i>...drink so much until it almost kills you?</i>

387
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,881
Well, if this is your idea of fun,
then I just don't know.

388
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,635
I need some money, Grandma.

389
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,222
He all right?

390
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,390
Yeah, he's fine.

[groans]

392
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,318
Get home safe.

393
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:19,656
Where's he going? Sir, will you make sure
this young man gets home all right?

394
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,199
Where does he live?

395
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,534
It's just down in...

396
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,161
It's just by Marquette.

397
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:28,248
Well, this bus goes down 27th Street,
the whole way.

398
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,544
Yeah, that's what I mean, 27th Street.

399
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,338
Okay, thank you.

Hey, man, it's the end of the line.

[faintly] This is the end of the line.

- You OD'd. You're lucky to be alive.

Huh? Hold... Hold on. Uh...

00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,309
I don't do drugs.

415
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,061
You did last night.

416
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:15,897
No, I...

417
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:23,196
Ma'am, a guy I met last night,
he was weird.

418
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:26,825
He must have
slipped something in my drink.

419
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,785
[exhales]

420
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,328
Dude tried to kill me.

421
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,040
[nurse] You should talk to the police.

422
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:45,051

- [siren wailing]

423
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,096
[detective] <i>So you're saying
this guy drugged you.</i>

424
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,764
<i>How exactly did he do that?</i>

425
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,808
He put something in my coffee.

426
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:56,938
I had one drink at the club, officer,
then I take two sips of this coffee,

427
00:30:57,021 --> 00:31:00,066
suddenly the room's spinning,
I can't talk.

428
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,819
So it wasn't caffeine or...?

429
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,195
It was Sanka.

430
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,282
Then I wake up
the next afternoon in a hospital bed.

431
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,159
$200 is missing, my bracelet's gone.

432
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,745
I don't think the 200 bucks
and a bracelet...

433
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:14,509
I don't care about
getting robbed, officer.

434
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:16,124
This guy is drugging people.

435
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:17,875
Look...

436
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,255
I went down to the bathhouses.

437
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,632
They say they know this guy, Jeff.

438
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,175
He's blond.

439
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:29,721
He isn't allowed in anymore
on account of he's drugging people.

440
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,100
Okay.

441
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,228
Like I said, we'll look into it.

442
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:43,526
I'm not asking you to look into it.
I'm asking you to go and stop this guy.

443
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,903
I understand.

444
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,573
But stuff like this
is really hard to prove.

445
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,575
Go to this man's house.

446
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,453
Whatever he's using is gonna be there.

447
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,496
- You know where his house is?
- Yes!

448
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,498
I thought I was
gonna die in his living room.

449
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,417
It's on 57th. Uh...

450
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,838
Between Hayes and Lincoln.
I know right where it is.

451
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:06,591
Well, Jeff,
what do you have to say for yourself?

452
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:10,470
Honestly, I don't know
what he's talking about.

453
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:15,058
I met this guy at the bar,
and his car needed a jump,

454
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,769
and he was really drunk.

455
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:21,230
So I said,
"You know, come back to my house

456
00:32:21,314 --> 00:32:24,067
and try to sober up,
have a cup of coffee."

457
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,903
And he just... He fell asleep on the chair.

458
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,783
Okay, so you're saying he was just drunk?

459
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,576
Yeah.

460
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,119
And had you been drinking?

461
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,915
- I had one beer, but I was fine.
- Jeffrey Dahmer.

462
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:43,127
What? I got a cop askin' me
what happened, so I'm tellin' him!

463
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,838
I was just trying to do a good thing.

464
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,175
I mean, this guy was wasted.
Trying to drive off in his car.

465
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,135
That's illegal, you know.

466
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:55,098
If I was to have a look around
in your bedroom,

467
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:59,394
I wouldn't find any, you know,
like, tranquilizers or whatnot?

468
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,941
No. I... I don't even know
what they would look like.

469
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:09,445
But sure, I mean, it's right upstairs,
if you wanna come take a look.

470
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,742
He said that you stole some money.

471
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:15,826
What?

472
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,246
And a bracelet?

473
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,248
No, I didn't.

474
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:24,627
My grandma was with me the whole time.
Grandma, did I look through his wallet?

475
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,711
No.

476
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:31,509
He did not, and I was there
the whole time. That is true.

477
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,471
And a bracelet?

478
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,474
[sighs] Jeez.

479
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,394

any kind of bracelet.

but we went to the house.

00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,152
Talked to him, talked to the grandma.

But you should know,

488
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,874
getting arrested doesn't suddenly
make you guilty of everything.

Yeah. Okay. Well, you know.

492

So, let me get this straight...

You're gonna take the word of a white guy
who's got a criminal record

over the word of a Black man
who doesn't have a criminal record.

That's what you're telling me, right?

'Cause I'm telling you
that this man tried to kill me.

there's nothing you can do about that?

yes, that's what I'm saying.

00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,503
[muffled] Step down!

533
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,642
Put that on the ground.

534
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,895
[indistinct police radio chatter]

535
00:38:48,743 --> 00:38:49,994
Come with us, please.

536
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,348
[man] <i>Mr. Dahmer, please stand.</i>

537
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,395
To the charge of sexual assault
in the second degree,

538
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,522
you have pled no contest.

539
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:23,527
Therefore, I hereby sentence you
to one year in the custody

540
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,030
of the Milwaukee County
House of Correction.

541
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,617
Now, Mr. Dahmer,

542
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,996
looking at you right now,
you remind me a lot of my grandson.

543
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:37,291
Now, he had a problem with alcohol.

544
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,668
But he turned it around.

545
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:43,214
And now he has a successful car wash.

546
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:48,386
You are not the kind of guy who belongs
in the correction system, okay?

547
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,263
You need a second chance.

548
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:55,393
And this is your lucky day
because I'm gonna give it to you.

549
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,979
And on the other side of this, hopefully
you will have learned your lesson

550
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,940
and you'll get your act together.

551
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:06,737
Now, I see
that you have steady employment.

552
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:11,742
So the court is willing to grant you
work release of up to 40 hours per week.

553
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,745
When you finish your work,
you report directly back to jail.

554
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:19,875
And while the court is obliged to inform
your employer of this arrangement,

555
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:22,795
I'm willing to do you the favor

556
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:26,924
of leaving out the exact nature
of your... misconduct.

557
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,427
Does that sound fair to you?

558
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:34,181
Yes. Thank you, Your Honor.

559
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:35,933
[gavel bangs]

560
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:56,662
Where are we going?

561
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,080
[sighs] Grandma's.

562
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:01,375
We're gonna have
one last dinner together as a family.

563
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,172
And then when you get out,
you're gonna get a place of your own.

564
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,592
Because we're at our wits' end
with you, Jeff.

565
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,178
Our wits' end!

566
00:41:15,181 --> 00:41:18,017
Roast is gonna take
about another ten minutes.

567
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,606
You want another beer, Jeff?

568
00:41:24,106 --> 00:41:25,316
Yeah, thanks.

569
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,319
You know, Jeff,

570
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:31,071
it was your grandmother
who paid your bail.

571
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:34,283
Okay? Twenty-five hundred dollars
is a lot for her.

572
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:37,036
You're gonna be expected to pay that back.

573
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:43,375
This whole thing was a setup.
All's I was doing was some photography.

574
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:44,460
Be quiet.

575
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,713
No more hobbies for me, I guess.

576
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,796
Enough.

577
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,427
[sighs]

578
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,513

[sighs]

580
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,822
Where is that box?

581
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,410
What box?

582
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,703
Don't play dumb.

583
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,207
Your grandmother has a box
with all my stuff in it.

584
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,752
Photos, ribbons, all my accomplishments.

585
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,713
And I want you to give it back.

586
00:42:30,422 --> 00:42:31,590
Go get it.

587
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:36,679
No, she gave it to me.

588
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,806
Goddammit, Jeff!

589
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,435
[sighs]

590
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:45,562
Get it.

591
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,078
Fine.

592
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:10,379
Are you gonna follow me?

593
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,131
Yes, I am.

594
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,131
Come on, open it.

595
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,550
I can't. I lost the key.

596
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,552
Jeff, don't lie to me!

597
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,471
I'm not lying. I don't know where it is.

598
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:03,515
Oh godda...!
There's something bad in there, Jeff.

599
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:04,975
What is it, pornography?

600
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,602
No. It's just, like, my stuff.

601
00:44:06,685 --> 00:44:08,187
Is it gay pornography, Jeff?

602
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,191
Because all these years, I look under
your mattress, I don't find a <i>Playboy.</i>

603
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:14,860
Now you're going to jail
for molesting a 13-year-old boy.

604
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,821
No, it's just, like, my stuff,
like baseball cards!

605
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,323
You're not gonna tell me, are you?

606
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:21,158
Oh fuck,
I'll break the fuckin' thing open!

607
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,743
Come on, Dad! What the heck?

Open this fucking door, Jeff!

611
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:57,194
Don't break your box, Dad.
I found the key. Right here.

[Lionel panting]

613
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,463
It's just some pornos.

614
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,425
Put 'em in there
so Grandma wouldn't find 'em.

615
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,429
Sorry.

616
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,681
Yeah.

We... we better get down there. Yeah.

[melancholy music playing]

621
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:01,425
Hon, I know you're upset.

622
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,677
It's okay.

623
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:08,682
No one likes to know that their son's
going to prison in the morning.

624
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:11,685
I just keep asking myself...

625
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,355
Did I do this to him?

626
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,817
- I mean it. Did I...
- [Shari] Sweetheart.

627
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,488
[sighing] I mean, should
I have stayed in that fucking marriage?

628
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:26,116
Should I have done
more things with him like taxidermy?

629
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,284
He really loved that stuff.

630
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:29,119
Honey, you can't do that to yourself.

631
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,538
Because I really should've
pushed back harder.

632
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:35,167
I should've pressed him harder
to find out what was really going on.

633
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,085
You know?

634
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:41,465
But the truth is,
he made me uncomfortable.

635
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,967
And I really didn't wanna know...

636
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:45,385
[sobs]

637
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:52,601

[sniffles] God.

640
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:06,031
And I asked him.
You know, every time I asked him.

641
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:08,659
[telephone ringing]

642
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,581
Hello?

643
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:18,961
Discharged?

644
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,048
What the heck happened, Jeff?

645
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:28,387
I don't know.
Guess they thought I drank too much.

646
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,139
They never really said.

647
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:34,351
So, what... [chuckles]

648
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,814
What the heck are you doing
with a mannequin, Jeff?

649
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,066
What? Did you steal it?

650
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,780
I just did it on a dare.
Whole thing was just a joke.

651
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,448
Oh.

652
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,951
[scoffs]

653
00:47:53,203 --> 00:47:54,621
[twig snaps]

654
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,589
So, what were you doing
at the State Fair, Jeff?

655
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:05,841
Exposing yourself?

656
00:48:08,927 --> 00:48:12,764
I was just peeing outside.
I didn't know anyone could see.

657
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,495
Thanks for getting me, Dad.

658
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:45,130
Why did you molest that boy?

659
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,341
- Jeff?
- I didn't molest him.

660
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,593
All's I did was take photos.

661
00:48:49,676 --> 00:48:50,969
Don't bullshit me.

662
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,138
I'm telling you.
Didn't even know how old he was.

663
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:55,381
Kid said you molested him.
Why would he lie about that?

664
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:58,727
I don't know. I don't know why.
All's I did was take some pictures.

665
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,104
I was even gonna pay him.

666
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:04,399
It was all a setup.

667
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:08,362
People are out to get me, Dad.
I don't understand it either.

668
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:12,198
[Lionel sighs]

669

[vehicle starts]

That kid's father...

671
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:23,168
I can't stop seeing the look in his eye.

672
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,800
He looked right at me.

673
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:36,139
Jeff Dahmer knew my son was a child.

674
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:40,644
When he met my son, he asked him

675
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,147
what grade in school he was in.

676
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:49,027
If my son was not so healthy and athletic,

677
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:54,116
the drug that this man gave my son
could have killed him...

678
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:59,037
Mr. Sinthasomphone,
I'm sorry. It's just, uh...

679
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,373
I am having trouble understanding you.

680
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,710
Could one of your children
maybe help us out here?

681
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,172
Thank you.

00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:39,828
Okay. Okay.

692
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:43,665
Maybe if your father would like
to hand his letter to the bailiff,

693
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,001
we can enter it into the record.

694
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,426
Mr. Dahmer, please stand.

695
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:01,725

<i>Dear Judge Gardner,
I believe very strongly</i>

700

[inmate] You're the one

- Hey, Jeff. Ah. You look great.
- Hey.

719
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:06,933
You lost some weight.

720
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,603
- Well, that's good to hear.
- Yeah.

721
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:10,812
Yeah.

722
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:13,023
Good thing was
I got to lift weights a lot.

723
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,275
And read a lot.

724
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,820
- And going to work every day, that helped.
- Yeah.

725
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,740
But, yeah, been doing good, you know.

726
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:23,783
Behaving myself.

727
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:27,954
Great. Just... That's just great.

728
00:53:29,789 --> 00:53:31,333
Um, well,

729
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:34,461
so you're gonna be staying with
your grandma for a week and that's it.

730
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:36,546
Then you gotta find
an apartment on your own.

731
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,299
- But Shari and I'll help you with that.
- Okay.

732
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:41,300
Um...

733
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,055
Jeff, when you were in there, uh...

734
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,183
uh, did anybody help you?

735
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,518
You know, like a psychologist,

736
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,854
or did you talk to anybody,
like a counselor?

737
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,106
About what?

738
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,316
Uh, anything.

739
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:59,444
Um, you know, alcohol for one or, um...

740
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,696
you know, just how you're...

741
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,491
You know, what's going on inside of you.

742
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:10,580
Or maybe, um, you know, some guidance
on how you're meant to be, um...

743
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:14,334
You know... [chuckles]
You know, contribute to society.

744
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:18,088
I don't know. Just, you know,
stuff I wasn't able to teach you.

745
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,464
[chuckles]

746
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,842
No, they just leave you alone in there.

747
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:29,266
I just kept to myself the whole time.
That was kind of the best part.

748
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:39,693
Come on. You said
we could stop for hamburgers.

749
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,195
Yeah, um, here.

750
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,490
Why don't you warm up the car?

751
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:48,076
I'm parked down at the very end.
I'm gonna hit the john.

752
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,244
- Okay.

754
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,927
[sighs]

755
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,317
[Jeffrey] Well, here it is.

756
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,741
Oh, shoot. Uh...

757
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:39,251
Sorry.

758
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,962
Trying to learn it.

759
00:55:43,548 --> 00:55:44,883
Just read my lips.

760
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,304
I live here.

761
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:19,292
